# 🧠 AI Maze Solver & Chase Game  

This project is part of an **Artificial Intelligence** coursework focusing on **search algorithms** and **game AI** for solving mazes. It combines **pathfinding techniques** with an interactive game where a **ghost chases a player in the maze**.  

## 🚀 Features  

### 🏗️ Maze Generation  
- Generates random `N × N` mazes with adjustable obstacle density.  
- Ensures at least one valid path between the **Start (S) and Finish (F)** positions.  

### 🔍 AI Pathfinding Algorithms  
- Implements both **uninformed search** (BFS, DFS) and **informed search** (A*, Greedy Best-First).  
- Compares execution time and efficiency of different algorithms.  
- Visualizes the optimal path from start to finish.  

### 👻 Ghost Chase Game  
- A **player moves through the maze** while avoiding a chasing ghost.  
- The **ghost uses AI pathfinding** to locate and chase the player dynamically.  
- The game simulates **real-time decision-making**, where the ghost adapts based on the player's movement.  
- Supports **different difficulty levels**, modifying the ghost's intelligence.  

### 📊 Performance & Analysis  
- Compares different AI algorithms in terms of execution time and path efficiency.  
- Displays **visual representation of the maze and paths** for better understanding.  
- Logs statistics on algorithm performance.
